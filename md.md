To ensure that the libraries are properly installed and built before building the Docker images for your Next.js client and Node.js server, you need to make sure that the client and server Dockerfiles are set up correctly to use the built libraries. 

Here's an updated workflow to install and build libraries, followed by building the server and client images, ensuring that libraries are available:

### Updated GitHub Actions Workflow

```yaml
name: Build and Push Docker Images

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - v*  # Trigger on version tags like v1.0.0

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up QEMU for multi-platform builds
      uses: docker/setup-qemu-action@v2

    - name: Set up Docker Buildx
      uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v2

    - name: Install Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '16'  # Specify your Node.js version

    - name: Install dependencies and build libraries
      run: |
        cd ./packages/libs  # Change to your libs directory
        npm install          # Install library dependencies
        npm run build        # Build the libraries

    - name: Login to Docker Hub
      uses: docker/login-action@v2
      with:
        username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
        password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_TOKEN }}

    - name: Cache Docker layers
      uses: actions/cache@v3
      with:
        path: /tmp/.buildx-cache
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-buildx-${{ github.sha }}
        restore-keys: |
          ${{ runner.os }}-buildx-

    - name: Build and push Next.js Docker image
      uses: docker/build-push-action@v3
      with:
        context: ./packages/client  # Adjust to your Next.js app path
        file: ./packages/client/Dockerfile  # Adjust to your Dockerfile path
        build-args: |
          LIB_PATH=./libs  # Pass the library path as a build argument
        push: true
        tags: |
          sa2avroo/nextjs-standalone-new:latest
          sa2avroo/nextjs-standalone-new:${{ github.sha }}
          sa2avroo/nextjs-standalone-new:${{ github.ref_name }}

    - name: Build and push Node.js server Docker image
      uses: docker/build-push-action@v3
      with:
        context: ./packages/server  # Adjust to your Node.js server path
        file: ./packages/server/Dockerfile  # Adjust to your Dockerfile path
        build-args: |
          LIB_PATH=./libs  # Pass the library path as a build argument
        push: true
        tags: |
          sa2avroo/nodejs-server:latest
          sa2avroo/nodejs-server:${{ github.sha }}
          sa2avroo/nodejs-server:${{ github.ref_name }}

    - name: Logout from Docker Hub
      run: docker logout
```

### Key Adjustments:

1. **Library Installation**:
   - The step to install and build the libraries remains unchanged, ensuring the libraries are built before building the Docker images.

2. **Build Args**:
   - Added `build-args` to both the client and server build steps. This allows you to pass the library path to your Dockerfiles.

### Example Dockerfile for Client and Server

You need to adjust your `Dockerfile` for both the client and the server to use the `LIB_PATH` build argument. Hereâ€™s an example of what your Dockerfiles might look like:

#### Client Dockerfile (`./packages/client/Dockerfile`)

```dockerfile
# Use an appropriate base image
FROM node:16 AS build

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the package.json and package-lock.json
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy libraries built earlier
COPY ${LIB_PATH} ./libs  # Adjust the path as needed
COPY . .

# Build the Next.js app
RUN npm run build

# Start the app
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

#### Server Dockerfile (`./packages/server/Dockerfile`)

```dockerfile
# Use an appropriate base image
FROM node:16 AS build

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the package.json and package-lock.json
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy libraries built earlier
COPY ${LIB_PATH} ./libs  # Adjust the path as needed
COPY . .

# Start the server
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### Important Notes:
- Ensure that the `LIB_PATH` in the Dockerfiles matches the directory structure where your libraries are built.
- You may need to adapt the `COPY` commands in the Dockerfiles depending on where the libraries are located after the build step.
- Make sure to test locally to confirm the library paths are set up correctly before pushing to your CI/CD pipeline.
